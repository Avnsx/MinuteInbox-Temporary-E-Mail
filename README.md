## Description
Create temporary e-mails and receive e-mails with MinuteInbox through python! It also parses the E-Mail email address MinuteInbox created for you; so you can directly access last and first name. And in case you needed it, it creates a company name out of them too üéâ

## Installation
Install python and tick pip in the python installer. Afterwards you will be able to install this repo just by pasting below into ``cmd.exe``
```
pip install minuteinbox_py
```
``bs4`` is a required dependency, if you're downloading the repo through GitHub.
## Example
```python
from minuteinbox import create_email, get_inbox
from time import sleep as s

# create an email
minuteinbox = create_email()
if minuteinbox:
	email = minuteinbox.get('email')
	first_name = minuteinbox.get('fname')
	last_name = minuteinbox.get('lname')
	company_name = minuteinbox.get('company')
	print('Current E-Mail: '+email+'\n'+'First & Last Name: '+first_name+' '+last_name+'\n'+'Company Name: '+company_name)


# get received email body
while True:
	inbox = get_inbox()
	if inbox != None:
		subject = inbox.get('subject')
		sender = inbox.get('sender')
		raw_body = inbox.get('raw_body') # raw text body
		clean_body = inbox.get('clean_body') # bs4 parsed body
		print('\nNew E-Mail titled: "'+subject+'", from: '+sender)
		print('\n'+'E-Mail Body:'+'\n'+clean_body)
		break
	s(3)
  ```
Output:
```
Current E-Mail: jahsiah.ayman@toiletkeys.net
First & Last Name: Jahsiah Ayman
Company Name: Ayja LLC

New E-Mail titled: "Meeting Minutes Defined", from: ahane 

E-Mail Body:
The meeting could be pretty intense and overwhelming for all members of the project. Therefore, it is natural that some of the participants are missing some details or slight information although they have taken personal notes on their device or paper. Kind Regards Copy Paste Emails
```
## Known Bugs
If there is weird special characters in the subject or the senders name, MinuteInbox tends to just send an empty response instead. That in return causes an error in this code. I've not found a bug fix for that yet. 
## Additional Knowledge
Dependent on how many people show me that they're liking the code by giving ‚≠ê's on this repo, I'll expand functionality & push more quality of life updates.
